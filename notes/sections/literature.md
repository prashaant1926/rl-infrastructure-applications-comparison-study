# Literature Review: Reinforcement Learning Infrastructure vs. Domain-Specific Applications

## Executive Summary

This comprehensive literature review examines the current state of reinforcement learning (RL) research, focusing on the comparative analysis between RL infrastructure development and domain-specific applications across three key sectors: healthcare, financial trading, and industrial systems. Our analysis reveals a fundamental tension between building robust, generalizable RL platforms and developing specialized solutions for specific application domains.

## 1. Introduction and Scope

Reinforcement learning has emerged as a critical paradigm in artificial intelligence, with applications spanning from game-playing systems to real-world industrial control. The field faces a strategic choice: invest in building comprehensive infrastructure that can serve multiple domains, or focus on domain-specific optimizations that maximize performance in particular applications.

This review synthesizes recent literature (2022-2025) to understand:
- The current state of RL infrastructure development
- Domain-specific RL applications in healthcare, finance, and industry
- Comparative advantages and limitations of each approach
- Emerging gaps and future research directions

## 2. RL Infrastructure and Platform Development

### 2.1 Distributed RL Systems

Recent advances in distributed reinforcement learning infrastructure have focused on scalability and parallelization. Li et al. (2024) provide a comprehensive survey of acceleration methodologies for deep RL, identifying key architectural patterns for parallel and distributed computing [1]. The work categorizes literature into learning system architectures, simulation parallelism, and distributed synchronization mechanisms, comparing 16 current open-source platforms.

Key findings indicate that distributed RL systems require careful balance between:
- **Computation parallelization**: Distributing neural network training across multiple GPUs/nodes
- **Environment parallelism**: Running multiple environment instances simultaneously
- **Synchronization mechanisms**: Ensuring consistency in distributed parameter updates

### 2.2 Industry-Grade RL Platforms

Ray RLLib has emerged as a leading industry-standard platform for scalable RL, offering production-level support for multi-agent setups, offline learning, and external simulator integration [2]. The platform supports diverse verticals including gaming, robotics, finance, and industrial control, demonstrating the viability of general-purpose RL infrastructure.

Comparative analysis of RL frameworks reveals distinct trade-offs:
- **Ray RLLib**: Excellent scalability, distributed training, but complex setup
- **Stable-Baselines3**: Simple API, extensive algorithms, limited scalability
- **OpenAI Gym**: Standard environments, easy prototyping, basic infrastructure
- **Isaac Lab**: Robotics-focused, high-performance simulation, domain-specific

### 2.3 Theoretical Foundations

Korkmaz (2024) addresses fundamental generalization challenges in deep RL, identifying overfitting as a core limitation that affects infrastructure design [3]. The survey reveals that general-purpose RL systems face inherent trade-offs between:
- **Generalizability**: Ability to work across diverse domains
- **Sample efficiency**: Speed of learning in specific environments  
- **Robustness**: Performance consistency across distribution shifts

## 3. Domain-Specific Applications
